<h3>Week 5: 3D Design & Printing</h3>

<h4>For this week we 3D printed an object and used photogrammetry to create a 3D model of a real object. 
</h4>
<h4>For the 3D printing part, I focused on designing an objevt that would be difficult to fabricate using substractive techniques.
  Consequently, I designed the following object. It's sharp edges and small features make it difficult if not impossible
  for traditional milling machines to fabricate. Here is the design in Fusion 360, and the result of the print: 
</h4>

<h4>Furthermore, I also engaged in photogrammetry to create a 3D model. Initially, I tried to 3D scan one of the acorns that
  trees are dropping around Harvard Square. However, this object proved to be too small; additionally, since it wasn't able
  to stand on its own, the scan would have had to be done while holding the object, further complicating the process. Therefore, I
  decided to scan my hand. Firstly I tried to do it with my hand spread out but the results weren't satisfactory since turning
  my hand while keeping it steady proved to be difficult since by twisting my hand my fingers would move. Consequently, 
  I opted for a closed fist, which was easier to keep steady while rotating my hand. Here are the results of my 3D scan:
