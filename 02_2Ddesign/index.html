<h3>Week 2: 2D Design & Cutting</h3>


<h4>Assignment: Make a Box</h4>
<h5>This assignment gave me insights into the inherent back and forth of every engineering design process.
  Firstly, for my design I wanted a box that could have a smaller box inside of it so I could either store smaller
  or simply have different compartments for when I need to store 2 things separately. Therefore, I designed this in 
  Fusion 360.

<h3>However, when I tried to extract the planes of each face, there were 2 main problems:</h3>
<br></br>
<h3>1. When I went to the laser cutter I could not quite integrate all their dxf files into a single one. 
  Since each piece had it's own sketch, and thus dxf files, they werem't imported together in Rhino. I could have make them coincide,
  but when I tried that I realized that my design did not fit within the laser cut limits so it wouldn't bbe useful regardless.
  Nevertheless, I did print one piece of the box to see how it would look like and wether my sketch conveyed what
  I wanted to fabricate. Here is the image of said piece:

<br></br>
<h3>2. The second problem was that I had not properly used all pertinent parameters, for the 'fingers' of the box, 
  I had only written numbers like '5' instead of making it a parameter that I could modify. The above described problem
  of my sketch not fitting within the laser cutter limits could have been solved by changing a parameter. I had registered
  all the width's and lengths as parameters, but not the number of fingers, therefore, when I changed the other dimensions, 
  the number of fingers remained the same and did not fit the new dimesnsions.</h3>
<br></br>
<h3>
  Consequently, I decided to start from scratch. The 3D model did help me to visualize my object, and enabled me to 
  design my 2D box with congidence and clarity. Before beginning, I created a word document with the constraints I 
  had to work with and predetermined the length and width in order to make sure it would fit within the laser cutter limits.

<h4>Additionally, we had to model to objects in Fusion after measuring them with the caliper. Here are the two objects
  I chose:

<h4>For the first object the process was quite straightforward excepto for one time I had to return to the lab to measure 
  a mising dimension. I enjoyed doing the triangular pattern that gives the tool its increased grip (although my computer may have not 
  enjoyed it as much). I am really satisfied with the outcome.
</h4>
<h4>For the second object, I found it more challenging. I was able to do everything by myself except for the tip of the screwdriver.
  I didn't really understand how to do it, so I searched a a video online:
