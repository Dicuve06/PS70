    Hi there!
    <br> My name is Diego Cuevas Vega and I'm an international student from Mexico City. I am a proud resident of Thayer Hall 
    and member of the class of 2029.
    <br> I am interested in concentrating in Electrical Engineering and doing a secondary concentration in Economics. 
    I want to study EE because I want to become an entrepreneur and help innovate in the area of robotics bringing a novel sustainable approach.
    <br> Fun Facts:
    <br>     I speak 4 languages (Spanish, English, French German)
    <br>     I like doing model-making in wood (see more below)

<hh>Model-making</hh>
<br> Model-making been one of the most relzing but also transformative hobbies I've engaged in. The assembling of different components
and then seeing them coming together to perform a task convinced me that I wanted to go into Engineering.
Here's a video of a wooden locomotor I assembled last year. This is my favorite model because it involves active movement.
