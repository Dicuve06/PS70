<h3>Week 7: Electronic Outputs</h3>
<h4>This week we had to use the oscilloscope to analyze our circuits, the time domain they lived in, and the associated speed.
  For this assignment I desided to resucitate my project from the previous week, the ultrasonic distance sensor that
  lighted up a green LED when an object was less than 10 cm away from the sensor. At the beginning I faced some 
  difficulties because I forgot to ground the oscilloscope itself. However, after correcting that with Bobby's help,
  I was able to get a coherent reading from the oscilloscope.

<h4>This graph, produced by the oscilloscope, let's us see that the time domain is within the seconds. The graph is 
  the result of triggering and untriggering the LED as fast as I could. The smallest interval is only 110 ms which 
  indicates that the time domain is really in the seconds rather than the miliseconds. Additionally, we can 
  observe the voltage around 3V when the LED turns on and around 0V when it is off. This is consistent with the circuit.
  Lastly, since this is an input triggered system, it is evident that the system is not subject to any clock or similar device.

<h3>Minimum Viable Product for Final Project</h3>
<h4>In addittion to the oscilloscope assignment, this week we had our 'midterm', which was to construct a Minimum
  Value Presentation (MVP) for our final project. My final project consists of creating a turning signal system for my bike. 
  Consequently, for this week I decided to create a prototype of the turning signal system by creating the 
  right turning signal only.
</h4>
<h4> The prototype entails the following components:
  <ul>
    <li> Right switch mechanism</li>
    <li> Right turning signal system wires</li>
    <li> 3D printed Base for mounting LED's</li>
    <li> Strip of LED's</li>
    <li> 3D printed clamp mechanism for right switch</li>
    <li> Related ESP32 and circuit </li>
    <li> Lots of tape </li>
  </ul>
</h4>
<h4> Here are some images of the prototype:
</h4>

<h4>Here is my MVP where I detail the design process and what I intend to improve or develop for the final presentation.</h4>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<h4> 
  <ul>
    <li> Always fround the oscilloscope</li>
    <li> When prototyping, a lot of things will change along the way</li>
    <li> Always start at least 4 days in advance</li>
    <li> Ask questions to the staff about which devices to use for specific tasks</li>
    <li> Reducing infill slightly increases flexibility for 3D printed components</li>
  </ul>
