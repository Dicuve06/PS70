<h3>Week 7: Electronic Outputs</h3>
<h5>This week we had to use the oscilloscope to analyze our circuits, the time domain they lived in, and the associated speed.
  For this assignment I desided to resucitate my project from the previous week, the ultrasonic distance sensor that
  lighted up a green LED when an object was less than 10 cm away from the sensor. At the beginning I faced some 
  difficulties because I forgot to ground the oscilloscope itself. However, after correcting that with Bobby's help,
  I was able to get a coherent reading from the oscilloscope.

<h5>This graph, produced by the oscilloscope, let's us see that the time domain is within the seconds. The graph is 
  the result of triggering and untriggering the LED as fast as I could. The smallest interval is only 110 ms which 
  indicates that the time domain is really in the seconds rather than the miliseconds. Additionally, we can 
  observe the voltage around 3V when the LED turns on and around 0V when it is off. This is consistent with the circuit.
  Lastly, since this is an input triggered system, it is evident that the system is not subject to any clock or similar device.

<h3>Minimum Viable Product for my Bicycle Turning Signal System</h3>
<h5>In addittion to the oscilloscope assignment, this week we had our 'midterm', which was to construct a Minimum
  Viable Product (MVP) for our final project. My final project consists of creating a turning signal system for my bike. 
  Consequently, for this week I decided to create a prototype of the turning signal system by creating the 
  right turning signal only.
</h5>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<h5> Initially, my motivation for this was to create a more comfortable and safer biking experience for myself. 
  I am new to the area, and I bought a bike to get to and from the SEC (Science and Engineering Complex). When
  I was brainstorming ideas for my final project, I wanted to come up with something that would cover a necessity. 
  That's how I came up with the idea of a turning signal system for my bike. When I bike, I often find myself in need
  of making a turn and having to use hand signals.
</h5>

<h5> However, using hand signals is not the most comfortable or safest way to indicate a turn, specially at night.</h5>
<img src="HandSignal.jpg" alt="Hand signal while biking at night" width="500" />
<h5> This lead me to think about bike accidents and the most common causes. That's how I discovered that one of the 
  most common causes of bike accidents is failure of drivers to notice bikers. And, even if we were to dress
  as highlighters, it would be still difficult to indicate our turns appropriately.
</h5>

<h5> Therefore, I decided to create a turning signal system for my bike that would allow me to indicate my turns 
  more comfortably and safely. For this project, I would define success as being able to get noticed before making
a turn, specially at night. Adittionally, I want the gesture for turning the turning signal system on to feel natural
and not be yet another difficulty.</h5>
<h5> These are my original sketches and the video of a product I used for inspiration.</h5>

<h4></h4>
<h5> The prototype used the following components:
  <ul>
    <li> Right switch mechanism</li>
    <li> Right turning signal system wires</li>
    <li> 3D printed Base for mounting LED's</li>
    <li> Strip of LED's</li>
    <li> 3D printed clamp mechanism for right switch</li>
    <li> Related ESP32 and circuit </li>
    <li> Lots of tape </li>
  </ul>
</h5>

<h5> Here are some images of the prototype:</h5>

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<h5> 
  <ul>
    <li> Always fround the oscilloscope</li>
    <li> When prototyping, a lot of things will change along the way</li>
    <li> Always start at least 4 days in advance</li>
    <li> Ask questions to the staff about which devices to use for specific tasks</li>
    <li> Reducing infill slightly increases flexibility for 3D printed components</li>
  </ul>
