<h4>Assignment: [Program something with IOT]</h4>
<h5>This week we learnt about the Internet of Things and different communication technologies. These topics in particular
  have application in nearly every single project. Personally, incorporating part of the feedback I received the previous
  week at the MVP, I plan to modify my turning signal system for it to use radio or ESP32-ESP32 communication to make
  the system wireless. This will make it more practical and easier to install on a bike.
</h5>
<h5>As for the project this week, I partnered with Xander Patton. We decided to create an 'emotional box'. Originally, 
  we wanted to create a box that would light up in different colors based on what the user reported thier mood to be on 
  a website. However, we noticed that we were missing an imput component. Therefore, my partner Xander suggested to 
  use a temperature sensor since that was really the way that mood rings work. 
</h5>

<h5> One of the most challenging parts was to be able to run the website because sometimes my computer disconnected
  from the WiFi or immediately switched to another netweork. However, after lots of trial and error, asking Kassia for help, 
  and pushing the Reset button, the website finally capitulated.

<h5>Initially, I focused on developing the code for the LED strip to fluctuate according to the feelings the 
  user reported on the website. I used Adafruit's NeoPixel library to control the LED strip. The code was fairly
  straightforward since I had experience with LED strips from previous weeks and it became a chain of if statements.
  Next, I focused on incorporating the temperature sensor. I used the analogRead function to read the values from the sensor
  and mapped those values to a range of colors. Some difficulties were that I had initially misinterpreted the 
  temperature sensor's range and created if statements with values out of reach. After fixing that, I was able to
  get the response I wanted. 
</h5>

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<br/>
<h5>1. Creating a LAN server is straightforward by using the WiFi SimpleWiFi server library</h>
<br/>
<h5>2. Sometimes the websites do not load properly and one of the best things one can do is to push the REset button.
</h5>
<br/>
<h5>3. When working with IoT, all devices ought to be connected to the same network. 
</h5>
<br/>
<h5>4. Mood rings are not that mysterious after all; they just use temperature sensors to change colors.
