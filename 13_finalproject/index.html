<h3>Final Project: BIKE TURNING SIGNAL SYSTEM</h3>

<h5>VIDEO PLACEHOLDER</h5>

<h5>Process</h5>

<h5>In addition to the <a href="../07_outputs/index.html"></a>MVP progress. This couple of weeks we were assigned to continue developing
  our projects and figure out the main challenges. For my project, at the MVP stage I had already created all the components needed,
  and in theory I justt needed to solder and encapsulate everything. However, after the MVP, I received a lot of feedback
  which helped me imporve my designs. The main improvements I focused on were the following:</h5>

<h4>1. Improve Visibility</h4>
<h5>1. Improve visibility of the lights. One of my concerns previous to the MVP was whether the LED's would be visible
  and truly make bikes visible. After pondering upon that, I decided to change the 5V LED strip to a 12V LED strip>
